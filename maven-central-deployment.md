# RedG Deployment Guide

This is a step-by-step guide on how to deploy RedG to Maven Central vie the Sonatype Repository.

## Important links for more information

 - [The OSSRH guide](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html)

## Prerequisites

 - Have GPG installed and have an RSA key where the public key is published to the most common key servers (at least to hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net)
 - Have a Sonatype Jira Account with permissions to deploy for `com.btc-ag.redg`
 
## Configuration files

There is some stuff you need in your `~/.m2/settings.xml`:

````xml
<settings ...>
	<!-- ... -->
	<!-- if inside BTC corporate network, configure your local proxy (squid, cntlm) here -->
	<proxies>
		<proxy>
			<id>my-proxy</id>
			<active>true</active>
			<protocol>https</protocol>
			<host>127.0.0.1</host>
			<port>3128</port>
		</proxy>
	</proxies>
	<!-- ... -->
	<servers>
		<server>
			<id>gpg.passphrase</id>
			<passphrase>YOUR_GPG_KEY_PW_HERE</passphrase>
		</server>
		<server>
			<!-- The credentials for Sonatype OSSRH Jira -->
			<id>ossrh</id>
			<username>username-here</username>
			<password>pw-here</password>
		</server>
		<server>
			<!-- The credentials for GitHub here (If you have enabled 2FA, generate an peronal access token and use it instead) -->
			<id>github</id>
			<username>username-here</username>
			<password>pw-here</password>
		</server>
	</servers>
	<!-- ... -->
	<profiles>
        <id>ossrh</id>
        <activation>
            <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
        </activation>
        <properties>
            <gpg.executable>gpg2</gpg.executable>
			<gpg.passphrase>YOUR_GPG_KEY_PW_HERE_AGAIN</gpg.passphrase>
			<gpg.keyname>GPG_KEY_NAME_HERE</gpg.keyname>
        </properties>
	</profiles>
</settings>

## Test the build

Before you even try to perform a release, test that everything is configured properly and working by running `mvn clean install -P release`. 
This tests the GPG signing and the Javadoc and builds all required artifacts for Sonatype.

## Build and release

Run `mvn release:clean release:prepare` to prepare the release and answer all the questions concering the version numbers.

Afterwards is a good time to merge the newly created tag into the master branch, so that master contains exactly the lastest version that will soon be available on Maven Central.

Now you can perform the actual release by running `mvn release:perform`.
If no errors occur, the release will be available on Central in the next few hours.
